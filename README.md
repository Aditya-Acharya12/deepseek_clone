# üß† DeepSeek Clone

A full-stack AI chatbot application inspired by **DeepSeek**, powered by Google‚Äôs **Gemini Pro API**. Built using **Next.js (App Router)**, **Clerk for authentication**, and **MongoDB**, this project recreates the real-time chat experience of modern AI tools, with elegant UI, chat history persistence, and smooth transitions.

This project not only simulates a real AI chat interface, but also served as a great hands-on learning experience in full-stack development, API integration, and scalable architecture.
